title: Week 2
---

I conducted two mock interviews one with Saad and the other with Terran. The mock interviews consisted of Saad and Terran each adopting a different persona. Saad was a therapist with no experience with socially assistive robots(SAR); whereas, Terran was a school therapist with some basic usage of SARs. 

After each interview and feedback, I iterated on the design prototype, totalling to 4 iterations. Major feedbacks included: 

<ul>
  <li>Initial visualizations weren't helpful. It focused too much on PeerBots data vs how a therapist reflect on their sessions in general</li>
  <li>Determine a better strategy on how to gather insight if a therapist has never used SARs before</li>
  <li>Ask more detailed questions about a therapists' workflow before and after a session</li>
  <li>Regarding the summary report, ask open-ended questions to see what other types of visualizations will be important that is not already included</li>
</ul>


Below is a screenshot of the final design sketch for the Session Summary Report completed after Week 2:
