I conducted two mock interviews one with Saad and the other with Terran. The mock interview consisted of Saad and Terran each adopting a different persona. Saad was a therapist with no experience with socially assistive robots(SAR); whereas, Terran was a school therapist with some basic usage of SARs. 

After each interview and feedback, I iterated on the design prototype, totalling to 4 iterations this week.
