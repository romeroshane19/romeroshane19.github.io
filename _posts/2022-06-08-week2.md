I conducted two mock interviews one with Saad and the other with Terran. Saad was a therapist with no experience with socially assistive robots(SARs). I found it difficult to present the initial design sketch to him because he didn't have SAR experience and my initial design was based on the metadata of PeerBots. This made me realize that I needed to generalize my design so non-SAR users can understand it. My initial approach was to design for PeerBots when I should've designed for therapists and educators(T/Es). 

Terran was a school therapist with some experience with SARs. This interview went more smoothly and I learned that preparation is also an important workflow to consider when designing a tool for T/Es. There is some customization that goes into each client/ class depending on the child/ group's goal(s). This resulted in adding editable fields and free-form text boxes to allow for more customization and reflection. There is also an ability to share the report. The idea is to allow T/Es to easily reflect on their session and share it with necessary groups without having to write things down again. I wonder if existing fields are not allowed based on HIPAA and other regulations.
