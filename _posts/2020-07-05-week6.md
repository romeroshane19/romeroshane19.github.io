I completed 3 user interviews that led to more succint visualizations for my summary reports. It was important for users to quickly understand and pull out important metrics when looking at graphs. As a therapists/ educator, you don't have a ton of time to reflect on how a session went, so having a summary report that's easily digestable is key.  
I ended up combining some of my graphs for this exact reason and summarizing key data points at the top of the page. This way if users don't have to spend time analyzing the graphs and can know right away where they spend the most time on and some focus areas for the next session.
