title: Week 1

Prior to my first week, I met with my advisors (Tom Williams, Terran Mott and Saad Elbeleidy) to discuss my summer research goals and to learn more about the different projects at [MirrorLab](https://mirrorlab.mines.edu/). My two goals were to conduct user research and practice my development skills. We honed in on my focus for the summer which will be designing and developing a Session Summary Report for the [PeerBots](https://www.peerbots.org/) interface that will support the workflows of teleoperators. In our case, teleoperators are educators and therapists. 

During my first week, I completed the following: 
<ul>
  <li>CITI training which detailed best practices when coonducting research, and the rules and regulations surrounding it.</li>
  <li>Read relevant research papers on the usage oof socially-assitive robots, mainly PeerBots, in therapy.</li>
  <li>Drafted user interview questions.</li>
  <li>Created research timeline with a detailed breakdown of tasks for each week.</li>
  <li>Start sketching initial design of Session Summary Report.</li>
</ul>
