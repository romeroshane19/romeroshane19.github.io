title: Week 4

I conducted my first user interview! It flowed as expected and the participant brought up interesting insight that I haven't thought about. Based on this interview, I might not need to show a video on SARs (for those without experience) since much of the conversation is understanding T/Es' general workflow.

My response rate from cold outreach has been low so I followed up with the 25 therapists/educators(T/Es) I pinged last week and reached out to 9 new therapists and 8 new educators. I sourced child therapists on [PsychologyToday](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists/colorado?category=child-or-adolescent&page=4&spec=167) and found school directories that listed staff emails. I focused on STEM and Special Education teachers as they are more likely to use SARs. I also reached out to personal connections whom are teachers to see if they could introduce me to some folks. I have a goal of interviewing 10 participants in total (with an even split between T/Es). 

Lastly, I read a lot of research papers spanning reporting/ evaluation tools in therapy, teleoperation of SARs, tracking progress in therapy and started populating a reference document that I'll use when writing my CHI paper.
