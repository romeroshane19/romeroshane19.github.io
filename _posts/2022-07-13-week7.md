I completed my last design iteration based on my last interview. I also conducted data analysis using Dovetail to track any patterns between my interviews and flagging major themes. 

This research aims to answer the following questions: 
1) What type(s) of visualizations and summaries are important when reflecting on a session? 
<ul>
  <li>Summary statistics: How long each activity took, which goals/ subgoals did they work on, which activities? </li>
  <li> Pretty simple and quick </li>
  <li> Condensed </li>
  <li> Utilizes colors, graphs and charts </li>
  <li> If it includes questionnaires, its preferred to have checkboxes vs free response </li>
  <li> Social, emotional cues like mood </li>
  <li> Proficiency/ engagement/ child performance </li>
  <li> Progress over time </li>
  <li> Robot functionality: how well did it work? What took a while to do? </li>

</ul>

2) How does a summary report add value to the workflows of therapists and educators? 

<ul>
  <li> Helps them to quickly see where their time and energy is going into </li>
  <li> Helps determine how they should change their next session or if they need to update a certain activity </li>
  <li> Automated summaries help teachers/ educators when filling out progress reports or treatment plans for insurance or when sending progress to clients </li>
  <li> CREDIBILITY! Provides hard data to clients, administrators and insurance that their work is effective </li>
