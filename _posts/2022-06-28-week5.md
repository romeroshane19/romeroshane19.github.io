title: Week 5
---

This week consisted of multiple design iterations and a user interview. My design has expanded to include a progress report that summarizes multiple sessions. The motivation is to allow organizations and individuals to see progress over time. 
Users can attach the progress report in insurance claims or share it with their clients. 

I've continued to read research papers including papers that covered visualizations in healthcare.
