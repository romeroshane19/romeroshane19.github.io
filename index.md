## About My Project

The use of socially-assistive robots (SARs) in therapy and its effect on children have been widely researched; however, there hasn't been much focus on the users that operate these systems such as therapists and educators(T/Es). Though SARs have been proven effective with children, the extra workload for T/Es could be more trouble that it's worth. Shane's research is focused on understanding how and which tool(s) best support T/Es that can ultimately make it easier for them to integrate SARs in their classrooms and client sessions.
