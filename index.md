## About My Project

The use of socially-assistive robots in therapy and its effect on children have been widely researched; however, there hasn't been much focus on the users that operate these systems such as therapists and educators. Shane's research is focused on gathering data from therapists and educators via user interviews to design and develop a Session Summary Report that will support their workflows and ultimately help ease the use of socially-assistive robots in their classes and sessions.
