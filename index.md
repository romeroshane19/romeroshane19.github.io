## About My Project

The use of socially-assistive robots (SAR) in therapy and its effect on children have been widely researched; however, there hasn't been much focus on the users that operate these systems such as therapists and educators. Previous research have found that a lot of time is spent on preparation and paperwork which can make it difficult to integrate a new tool like SARs into existing programs. Though SARs have been proven effective with children, the extra workload is more trouble that it's worth. Shane's research is focused on understanding how and which tool(s) can best support therapists and educators, ultimately, making it easier for them to integrate SARs in their classrooms and client sessions.
