## About My Project

The use of socially-assistive robots in therapy and its effect on children have been widely researched; however, there hasn't been much focus on the users that operate these systems or teleoperators such as therapists and educators. The goal of Shane's research with MirrorLab is to design a session summary report that help teleoperators reflect on how their session went and identify areas of improvement and progress more quickly.
